+#### Limitations:
+Sweep is unlikely to complete complex issues on the first try, similar to the average junior developer. Here are Sweep's limitations(for now):
+- Try to change less than 200 lines of code
+- Try to modify less than 3 files
+- Do not include files with more than 1500 lines of code

+### ‚ú® Sweep Github App
+Setting up Sweep is as simple as adding the GitHub bot to a repo, then creating an issue for the bot to address.
+We support all languages GPT4 supports, including Python, Typescript, Rust, Go, Java, C# and C++.
+
+1. Add the [Sweep GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/sweep-ai) to desired repos

 ## üìò Story
 
 We were frustrated by small tickets, like simple bug fixes, annoying refactors, and small features. Each task required us to open our IDE to fix simple bugs. So we decided to leverage the capabilities of ChatGPT to address this directly in GitHub.
 
 Unlike existing AI solutions, this can solve entire tickets and can be parallelized + asynchronous: developers can spin up 10 tickets and Sweep will address them all at once.

+1. It is imperative that we do not leave any work to the user/future readers of this code. Therefore write functions with complete business logic.
+2. Only write code, do not write line numbers.
 3. Make sure the new code follows the same programming language conventions as the old code.
 
 Instead of writing "# Rest of Code", specify the lines to copy from the old file using an XML tag, inclusive (e.g., "<copy_lines A-B>"). Make sure to use this exact format.
 Copy the correct line numbers and copy as long of a prefix and suffix as possible. For instance, if you want to insert code after line 50, start with "<copy_lines 1-50>".
 
 Example: If you want to modify lines 51-52 and add line after line 75:
 <new_file>

For simpler problems, providing a single line and a file name should suffice.\n\nA good issue might include:\n\n| Where to look <br> **[file name or function name]**| What to do <br> **[change the logic to do this]** | Additional Context (optional) <br> **[there\'s a bug/we need this feature/there\'s this dependency]** |\n|-----------|------------|----------------------|\n|In `sweepai/app/ui.py`|use an os-agnostic temp directory|N/A|\n|In `on_comment.py`|we should not fire an event|because it\'s possible that the comment is on a closed PR|\n|In the config loader in `packages/server/src/config.ts`|add a third option called "env" to load the config settings from environment variables| At present, there are two options:  1. ... and 2. ...|\n\nIf you want Sweep to use a file, try to mention the full path. Similarly, to have Sweep use a function, try to mention the class method or what it does. Also see [‚ú® Tips and tricks for Sweep](https://docs.sweep.dev/tricks).\n\n### üñ•Ô∏è Sweep Chat\nSweep Chat allows you to interact with Sweep and GitHub locally. Collaborate on the plan with Sweep, then have it create the pull request for you. \n\n**Prerequisites:** Install [Sweep GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/sweep-ai) to your repository\n\n1. Run `pip3 install sweepai && sweep`. Note that you need **python 3.10+.**\n    - Alternatively run `pip3 install --force-reinstall sweepai && sweep` if the previous command fails.\n    - This runs GitHub authentication in your browser.\n\n2. Copy the üîµ blue 8-digit code from your terminal into the page. You should only need to do the authentication once.  \n    - Wait a few seconds and Sweep Chat will start. \n\n3. Choose a repository from the dropdown at the top (the Github app must be installed to this repository).\n\n    - ‚ö° Start chatting with Sweep Chat! ‚ö°\n\n<img src="https://github.com/sweepai/sweep/blob/856ff66c2dbeaf39afbf6d8c49a620dfa70271fb/.assets/gradio-screenshot.png">\n\nTips:\n* üîç Relevant searched files will show up on the right. \n* üîò Sweep Chat creates PRs when the "Create PR" button is clicked. \n* üí° You can force dark mode by going to http://127.0.0.1:7861/?__theme=dark.\n\n#### From Source\nIf you want the nightly build and or if the latest build has issues.\n\n1. `git clone https://github.com/sweepai/sweep && poetry install`\n2. `python sweepai/app/cli.py`. Note that you need **python 3.10+**.\n\n### ‚ú® Sweep Github App\nSetting up Sweep is as simple as adding the GitHub bot to a repo, then creating an issue for the bot to address.\nWe support all languages GPT4 supports, including Python, Typescript, Rust, Go, Java, C# and C++.\n\n1. Add the [Sweep GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/sweep-ai) to desired repos\n2. Create new issue in repo, like "Sweep: Write tests"\n3. Watch the magic happen ü™Ñ\n\n## ü§ù Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome and greatly appreciated! For detailed guidelines on how to contribute, please see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.\nFor more detailed docs, see [üöÄ Quickstart](https://docs.sweep.dev/start).\n\n## üìò Story\n\nWe were frustrated by small tickets, like simple bug fixes, annoying refactors, and small features.

For simpler problems, providing a single line and a file name should suffice.\n\nA good issue might include:\n\n| Where to look <br> **[file name or function name]**| What to do <br> **[change the logic to do this]** | Additional Context (optional) <br> **[there\'s a bug/we need this feature/there\'s this dependency]** |\n|-----------|------------|----------------------|\n|In `sweepai/app/ui.py`|use an os-agnostic temp directory|N/A|\n|In `on_comment.py`|we should not fire an event|because it\'s possible that the comment is on a closed PR|\n|In the config loader in `packages/server/src/config.ts`|add a third option called "env" to load the config settings from environment variables| At present, there are two options:  1. ... and 2. ...|\n\nIf you want Sweep to use a file, try to mention the full path. Similarly, to have Sweep use a function, try to mention the class method or what it does. Also see [‚ú® Tips and tricks for Sweep](https://docs.sweep.dev/tricks).\n\n#### Limitations:\nSweep is unlikely to complete complex issues on the first try, similar to the average junior developer. Here are Sweep\'s limitations(for now):\n- Try to change less than 200 lines of code\n- Try to modify less than 3 files\n- Do not include files with more than 1500 lines of code\n\n### ‚ú® Sweep Github App\nSetting up Sweep is as simple as adding the GitHub bot to a repo, then creating an issue for the bot to address.\nWe support all languages GPT4 supports, including Python, Typescript, Rust, Go, Java, C# and C++.\n\n1. Add the [Sweep GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/sweep-ai) to desired repos\n2.

 Sweep is an AI junior developer that transforms bug reports & feature requests
 into code changes. Describe bugs, small features, and refactors like you would
 to a junior developer, and Sweep: 1. √∞¬ü¬î¬ç reads your codebase 2. √∞¬ü¬ì¬ù plans the
 changes 3. √¢¬ö¬°**writes a pull request with code**√¢¬ö¬° See highlights at https://

 options: 1. ... and 2. ...| If you want Sweep to use a file, try to mention the
 full path. Similarly, to have Sweep use a function, try to mention the class
 method or what it does. Also see [√¢¬ú¬® Tips and tricks for Sweep](https://
-docs.sweep.dev/tricks). ### √∞¬ü¬ñ¬•√Ø¬∏¬è Sweep Chat Sweep Chat allows you to
-interact with Sweep and GitHub locally. Collaborate on the plan with Sweep,
+docs.sweep.dev/tricks). #### Limitations: Sweep is unlikely to complete complex
+issues on the first try, similar to the average junior developer. Here are
+Sweep's limitations(for now): - Try to change less than 200 lines of code - Try
+to modify less than 3 files - Do not include files with more than 1500 lines of
+code ### √¢¬ú¬® Sweep Github App Setting up Sweep is as simple as adding the
+GitHub bot to a repo, then creating an issue for the bot to address. We support
+all languages GPT4 supports, including Python, Typescript, Rust, Go, Java, C#
+and C++. 1. Add the [Sweep GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/sweep-ai) to
+desired repos 2. Create new issue in repo, like "Sweep: In sweepai/app/ui.py
+use an os-agnostic temp directory" ### √∞¬ü¬ñ¬•√Ø¬∏¬è Sweep Chat Sweep Chat allows you
+to interact with Sweep and GitHub locally. Collaborate on the plan with Sweep,
 then have it create the pull request for you. **Prerequisites:** Install [Sweep
 GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/sweep-ai) to your repository 1. Run `pip3
 install sweepai && sweep`. Note that you need **python 3.10+.** - Alternatively
 run `pip3 install --force-reinstall sweepai && sweep` if the previous command
 fails. - This runs GitHub authentication in your browser. 2. Copy the √∞¬ü¬î¬µ blue

+docs.sweep.dev/). ## √∞¬ü¬ì¬ò Story We were frustrated by small tickets, like
 simple bug fixes, annoying refactors, and small features. Each task required us
 to open our IDE to fix simple bugs. So we decided to leverage the capabilities
 of ChatGPT to address this directly in GitHub. Unlike existing AI solutions,
 this can solve entire tickets and can be parallelized + asynchronous:
 developers can spin up 10 tickets and Sweep will address them all at once. ##
