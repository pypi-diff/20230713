 # ðŸ¥Ÿ st-paywall
 
 <strong>A python package for creating paid Streamlit apps with a paywall! </strong>
 
+## Why st-paywall?
+
+I made st-paywall so data scientists and LLM developers can create small businesses around their Streamlit apps. Every week I see dozens of new incredible apps built in Streamlit that are adored by users, but eventually shut down or moved off of Streamlit as authentication and payment integration are too hard. This is my attempt at a dead-simple API around each, abstracting the both away into a single function (`add_auth`). Enjoy!
+
 ## Overview
 
-This package gives you one basic functions (`add_auth`) that adds subscription functionality to your Streamlit apps. `add_auth` will add both a Google login button if they are not logged in, and a Stripe subscription button to your sidebar if they are not subscribed. If they are subscribed, `st.session_state.user_subscribed` will be true, and if they are logged in, `st.session_state.email` will have their email.
+This package gives you one basic function (`add_auth`) that adds subscription functionality to your Streamlit apps. `add_auth` will add both a Google login button if they are not logged in, and a Stripe subscription button to your sidebar if they are not subscribed. If they are subscribed, `st.session_state.user_subscribed` will be true, and if they are logged in, `st.session_state.email` will have their email.
 If the `required` parameter is `True`, the app will stop with `st.stop()` if the user is not logged in and subscribed. Otherwise, you the developer will have control over exactly how you want to paywall the apps!
 
  I hope you use this to create tons of value, and capture some of it with the magic of Streamlit.
 
 This package expects that you have a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file which you will have to create. Inside it, you will need to add your Stripe and Google API information that runs the authentication and subscription parts of the package.
 
 ### Stripe
 
 In order to set up your Stripe (the best and easiest payment infrastructure in the world), go to [Stripe.com](https://stripe.com) and make an account. Once you make an account, you need to make a [payment subscription link](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payment-links/create) (which is in test mode by default) and add the link to your app (currently held in streamlit_app.py). If the user to your app logs in and has not already signed up and paid via Stripe, they will be asked to subscribe before they can see the rest of the app.
 
 The subscription link should be added to secrets.toml like this.
 
 ```toml
-stripe_link = 'https://buy.stripe.com/test_...'`
+stripe_link = 'https://buy.stripe.com/test_...'
 ```
 
 You also need to create an [Standard API key](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys), which just like subscription links have test options as well. Store your API key in your secrets file as stripe_api_key and you're off to the races. If you make a restricted API key instead of a Standard key, make sure to add read permission on Customers
 
 
 <img src="readme_img/stripe_api_rest.png" width="500">
 
 
 The API key should be added to `secrets.toml` like this
 
 
 ```toml
-stripe_api_key = 'sk_...'`
+stripe_api_key = 'sk_...'
 ```
 
 By default this repo links to creating test subscription links and test api keys (you probably already noticed the 'test' in the Stripe dashboard, the subscription link, and in our example api key). When you launch your app and want folks to pay real money, you will need to create production links and api keys from your [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com) and use those instead. While you are testing out the Stripe part of your code, you can use [Stripe's test cards](https://stripe.com/docs/testing) instead of inputting your own credit card info! To run st-paywall in test mode, add the following to your secrets file.
 
 ```toml
 testing_mode = true
 ```
 
 Then, the package will look for the following secrets. Otherwise, it will look for the production api and link secrets. I highly encourage you to start out in test mode!
 
 ```toml
-stripe_api_key_test = 'sk_test_...'`
-stripe_link_test = 'https://buy.stripe.com/test_...'`
+stripe_api_key_test = 'sk_test_...'
+stripe_link_test = 'https://buy.stripe.com/test_...'
 ```
 
 Once you decide to leave test mode and publish your subscription app, it is a good idea to have Stripe send the user back to your app once they've subscribed. To do this, go to the [payment links](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links) page, edit your payment link, click 'After payment' and fill out your app's url.

+### Buy Me A Coffee
+
+Not everywhere in the world is covered by Stripe! Buy Me A Coffee is a lighter, less business-y service that allows folks to support you online. To link to your buy me a coffee page instead of your Stripe payment link, go to their [dev page](https://developers.buymeacoffee.com/dashboard) and create an access token. You will also add a [membership product offering](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/membership) as well. Once you have the membership link and the key, add the following to your secrets file.
+
+```toml
+payment_provider = "bmac"
+bmac_api_key = "eyJ0...."
+bmac_link = "https://www.buymeacoffee.com/..."
+```
+
+This will change your app to link out to buymeacoffee instead of Stripe, and will get your customer list from there as well!

 # ðŸ¥Ÿ st-paywall
 
 <strong>A python package for creating paid Streamlit apps with a paywall! </strong>
 
+## Why st-paywall?
+
+I made st-paywall so data scientists and LLM developers can create small businesses around their Streamlit apps. Every week I see dozens of new incredible apps built in Streamlit that are adored by users, but eventually shut down or moved off of Streamlit as authentication and payment integration are too hard. This is my attempt at a dead-simple API around each, abstracting the both away into a single function (`add_auth`). Enjoy!
+
 ## Overview
 
-This package gives you one basic functions (`add_auth`) that adds subscription functionality to your Streamlit apps. `add_auth` will add both a Google login button if they are not logged in, and a Stripe subscription button to your sidebar if they are not subscribed. If they are subscribed, `st.session_state.user_subscribed` will be true, and if they are logged in, `st.session_state.email` will have their email.
+This package gives you one basic function (`add_auth`) that adds subscription functionality to your Streamlit apps. `add_auth` will add both a Google login button if they are not logged in, and a Stripe subscription button to your sidebar if they are not subscribed. If they are subscribed, `st.session_state.user_subscribed` will be true, and if they are logged in, `st.session_state.email` will have their email.
 If the `required` parameter is `True`, the app will stop with `st.stop()` if the user is not logged in and subscribed. Otherwise, you the developer will have control over exactly how you want to paywall the apps!
 
  I hope you use this to create tons of value, and capture some of it with the magic of Streamlit.
 
 This package expects that you have a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file which you will have to create. Inside it, you will need to add your Stripe and Google API information that runs the authentication and subscription parts of the package.
 
 ### Stripe
 
 In order to set up your Stripe (the best and easiest payment infrastructure in the world), go to [Stripe.com](https://stripe.com) and make an account. Once you make an account, you need to make a [payment subscription link](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payment-links/create) (which is in test mode by default) and add the link to your app (currently held in streamlit_app.py). If the user to your app logs in and has not already signed up and paid via Stripe, they will be asked to subscribe before they can see the rest of the app.
 
 The subscription link should be added to secrets.toml like this.
 
 ```toml
-stripe_link = 'https://buy.stripe.com/test_...'`
+stripe_link = 'https://buy.stripe.com/test_...'
 ```
 
 You also need to create an [Standard API key](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys), which just like subscription links have test options as well. Store your API key in your secrets file as stripe_api_key and you're off to the races. If you make a restricted API key instead of a Standard key, make sure to add read permission on Customers

 The API key should be added to `secrets.toml` like this
 
 
 ```toml
-stripe_api_key = 'sk_...'`
+stripe_api_key = 'sk_...'
 ```
 
 By default this repo links to creating test subscription links and test api keys (you probably already noticed the 'test' in the Stripe dashboard, the subscription link, and in our example api key). When you launch your app and want folks to pay real money, you will need to create production links and api keys from your [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com) and use those instead. While you are testing out the Stripe part of your code, you can use [Stripe's test cards](https://stripe.com/docs/testing) instead of inputting your own credit card info! To run st-paywall in test mode, add the following to your secrets file.
 
 ```toml
 testing_mode = true
 ```
 
 Then, the package will look for the following secrets. Otherwise, it will look for the production api and link secrets. I highly encourage you to start out in test mode!
 
 ```toml
-stripe_api_key_test = 'sk_test_...'`
-stripe_link_test = 'https://buy.stripe.com/test_...'`
+stripe_api_key_test = 'sk_test_...'
+stripe_link_test = 'https://buy.stripe.com/test_...'
 ```
 
 Once you decide to leave test mode and publish your subscription app, it is a good idea to have Stripe send the user back to your app once they've subscribed. To do this, go to the [payment links](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links) page, edit your payment link, click 'After payment' and fill out your app's url.

+### Buy Me A Coffee
+
+Not everywhere in the world is covered by Stripe! Buy Me A Coffee is a lighter, less business-y service that allows folks to support you online. To link to your buy me a coffee page instead of your Stripe payment link, go to their [dev page](https://developers.buymeacoffee.com/dashboard) and create an access token. You will also add a [membership product offering](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/membership) as well. Once you have the membership link and the key, add the following to your secrets file.
+
+```toml
+payment_provider = "bmac"
+bmac_api_key = "eyJ0...."
+bmac_link = "https://www.buymeacoffee.com/..."
+```
+
+This will change your app to link out to buymeacoffee instead of Stripe, and will get your customer list from there as well!
